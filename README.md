# HeatWarning
This mod will blast a quite loud audio warning at you when any part of the current vessel is above 70% of its maxTemp. You also get a visual indication with thermometers hovering over the overheating parts. The map view will pulse red.

A critical warning occurs at 90%. You can cancel the audible alarm with an ApplicationLauncher button.

Source code included in the zip file. To install, copy the HeatWarning directory in the zip, into your KSP installation's GameData directory.

Thanks to: Stupid_chris, Sarbian, NathanKell, Blizzy, Pizzaoverhead, and all the other #kspmodders who've had to listen to my inane questions and frustrated witterings.
